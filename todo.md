## To Do

### Important stuff

### Minor stuff
- [ ] Investigate zoom in slowdown
- [ ] Investigate z fighting
- [ ] Better loading predictions (pass currently focused body to renderer)
- [ ] Completeness for mipmap levels (add sampler in StreamTexture)
- [ ] Frustum culling
- [ ] Compute log average luminance for auto exposure
- [ ] Correct luminance values

### Stuff for later
- [ ] Support custom models (asteroids, phobos, deimos)
- [ ] Some kind of HUD (imgui)
- [ ] Vulkan implementation, one day

## Done
- [x] Put glViewport() where necessary

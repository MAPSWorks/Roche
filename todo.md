## To Do
- [ ] Initialization with {}
- [ ] Use lambdas for complex initialization
- [ ] Clean up planet structures
- [ ] Separate shaders & shader pipelines
- [ ] Correct flares
- [ ] Better texture streaming management
- [ ] PBOs
- [ ] Use BC7 for textures
- [ ] Sparse textures?
- [ ] Vulkan implementation, one day

## Done
- [x] Proper move semantics & const ref params
- [x] Change skipMipmap with maxSize
- [x] Proper CMake compile features
- [x] Move profiler to own file
- [x] Tell GL to do gamma correction itself
- [x] Override wherever possible
- [x] Remove SSAA option
- [x] Change gl_util to avoid memory copying (write/read directly)
